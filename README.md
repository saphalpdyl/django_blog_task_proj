django_blog_task_proj is a simple Django blog website. It was created as a training project for an internship, but it can be used as a starting point for your own Django project.

This project allows users to create, edit, and delete blog posts, as well as comment on other users' posts. It is still under development, but it is a great way to learn how to use Django to create a simple web application.
